# Maroa.ai — Project Knowledge Base

> **Last updated:** 2026-05-19. If this is more than a quarter old, treat
> it as suspect and verify against `git log` + the live code.

This file is the canonical architectural map. Read it before making any
non-trivial change. Pair with [LEARNINGS.md](./LEARNINGS.md) which is
the decision log explaining _why_ each piece is the way it is.

## 1. What this is

Maroa.ai is an AI marketing automation SaaS for small businesses
($5–$500/day ad budgets). Customers connect their Meta + Google + social
accounts; the system writes content, runs ads, scores creatives, tracks
competitors, fires lifecycle emails, generates CRO audits, and reports
weekly — without daily human input.

**Pricing tiers:** `starter ($25/mo)` · `growth ($59/mo)` · `agency ($99/mo)` ·
`enterprise (custom)` — enforced by `middleware/planGate.js` +
`middleware/planLimits.js` + `lib/costGuard.js`. Cancel-anytime
monthly billing. No free tier, no trial, no money-back guarantee.

## 2. Architecture (current — post-n8n migration)

Until ~Apr 2026 this ran on n8n Cloud. The 28 workflows are now
implemented as Express routes + Inngest functions in this repo. The
`n8n-workflows/` folder is legacy archive — nothing imports it.

Cross-cutting layers:

- **Observability** — JSON logs (correlation IDs), Prometheus `/metrics`,
  Sentry with PII scrubbing, `/healthz` + `/readyz`.
- **Cost discipline** — `lib/costGuard.js` per-business monthly cap;
  `services/observability/cost-tracker.js` records every Anthropic call.
- **Resilience** — `lib/circuitBreaker.js` per external API; Inngest
  retries with exponential backoff; 15s default external HTTP timeout.

## 4. Database schema highlights

Read `migrations/000_schema_bootstrap.sql` + the numbered migrations for
the truth. High-traffic tables:

Note: there are **138 tables** total. The schema is JSONB-heavy in the
event/audit space — payloads are stored as `jsonb` and queried with
`->>` operators. Add GIN indexes if you filter by a JSONB key in a hot path.

**Reserved / NOT-WIRED schema (audit 2026-05 — do not assume these work):**
`video_clips` (Personal Clipper — no writer/reader), `businesses.higgsfield_element_ids`
(Reference Elements — never written/read), `businesses.higgsfield_product_id`
(Marketing Studio — never written/read). Marked with `COMMENT ON` in migration 089. `higgsfield_generations` + `higgsfield_presets` are write-only today (no
consumer yet). Gen-time virality predictions persist to
`content_virality_predictions` (migration 089) — the migration-087
`content_performance` redefinition was a silent no-op (it collided with
migration 024's measurement table), so the writer was repointed.

## 5. Workflow inventory (current vs. original n8n)

The original n8n workflows are now implemented as a mix of Inngest
functions (scheduled + event-driven) and Express HTTP routes. This table
is reverse-engineered from the live code (`services/inngest/functions.js`

- `server.js` route registrations + `tests/`), **not** from the old n8n
  exports — those JSON files were deleted from the repo, so no byte-diff is
  possible. Verified 2026-05-25.

**Status legend**

- ✅ **firing** — registered in the Inngest `functions` array (verified by
  `tests/inngest-functions.test.js`) and runs on its cron, OR fires on a
  named event. These run unattended in production.
- 🟙 **mounted** — a reachable HTTP route, but only runs when something
  calls it. Per the `services/wf_batch_routes.js` header these have **no
  frontend `api.ts` contract yet**, so they are NOT confirmed firing in
  prod — they're callable, not driven.
- 🔴 **no test** — zero behavioural test coverage. Treat as unverified.
- 🟡 **shallow test** — only a factory-shape/contract or prompt-level
  smoke test; engine logic is not exercised.

### C. Post-migration named capabilities (HTTP routes, customer-facing)

- `services/cro/` — landing-page CRO audit + rewrites — ✅ `cro.test.js`
- `services/ai-seo/` — AI-search citability + llms.txt + JSON-LD — ✅ `ai-seo.test.js`
- `services/forecasting/` — ROAS + spend forecast 30/60/90 — ✅ `forecasting.test.js`
- `services/voc/` — voice-of-customer mining — ✅ `voc*.test.js`
- `services/social-multi/` — Ayrshare + Meta Graph publish — (covered via Meta publish tests)
- `lib/viralityPredictor.js` — internal Claude virality scorer; WF1 writes a
  `content_performance` row (virality_score / engagement / hook_strength /
  retention_risk) per generated asset — ✅ `virality-predictor.test.js`. NOT
  the Higgsfield first-party predictor; swappable behind `predictVirality()`.
- **Signup → brain wiring (migration 088):** `lib/websiteEnricher.js` fetches +
  Claude-summarizes the customer's site on signup into `businesses.website_summary`
  (rendered as `<website_analysis>`); `POST /api/business/:id/brand-assets` sets
  `logo_url` + `product_image_urls`, which WF1 passes as the Higgsfield reference
  image (`image_url`/`sourceImageUrl`) + a logo prompt cue. Tests:
  `website-enricher.test.js`, `wf1-engine-tdz.test.js`. Logo is a soft reference,
  not a pixel overlay (see migration 088).

- **WF28 — Google My Business poster: REMOVED.** Google killed the API in 2024.
- **WF04 — retention: MERGED** into the weekly scorecard.

### ⚠️ Test-coverage gaps (mounted but unverified)

These run customer-facing logic with **zero behavioural tests** — fix
before relying on them: **WF2** (lead scoring), **WF4** (reviews),
**WF7** (email lifecycle engine), **WF9** (inbox), and the
**ops/monthly-report** crons. (**WF10** studio is now covered by
`wf10-studio.test.js`.) The 🟡 "shallow" rows
(`anthropic-2026` / `wf-batch-contract`) only assert factory shape or
prompt wiring, not engine behaviour.

### ⚠️ Duplication — RESOLVED (see `CANONICAL_WORKFLOWS.md`)

The canonical engine per duplicated capability is now decided and recorded in
**`CANONICAL_WORKFLOWS.md`** (the binding contract for the dashboard UI):

- **Ad optimization** → `ad-optimizer` (canonical). `wf3` `@deprecated`.
- **Competitor intel** → `competitor-watch` (canonical). `wf5` `@deprecated`.
  The canonical engine lacked an on-demand surface, so per-business
  `/webhook/competitor-watch-scan` + `/webhook/competitor-watch-briefing`
  routes and a `maroa/manual.competitor-watch` Inngest event were added.
- **Email** → `email-lifecycle` (canonical). `wf7` `@deprecated`, and its
  `designSequence`/`dispatchDue` no longer write the shared `email_sequences`
  table (double-writer fixed). Added a `maroa/manual.email-lifecycle` event.
  ⚠️ `email_sequences` is still written by **two** other paths with divergent
  schemas — `routes/email-lifecycle.js` (`trigger_type`/`emails[]`/
  `contact_enrollments`) and the canonical service (`stage`/`cadence_days`/
  `email_sequence_runs`). Consolidating those two is a remaining follow-up.
- **CRO/SEO** → `cro` + `ai-seo` canonical. `wf6` `@deprecated` for its
  AI-SEO/schema overlap; its unique GBP/local-presence audit is **retained**
  pending a scoped fold into ai-seo as a "Local Presence" dimension.

Bind new UI/screens to the canonical only — never the deprecated twin. Also,
`autopilot-brain` and `ad-optimizer` both fire at `0 8 * * *` — confirm the
brain orchestrates rather than races the optimizer.

## 6. The 5 rules that matter

These are load-bearing. Breaking them creates silent bugs that take
weeks to find.

**Rule 1 — Single env source.** Read env vars from `env` (the validated
zod object), not `process.env`. Boot fails fast if anything required is
missing.

**Rule 2 — One callClaude.** Don't write raw `apiRequest` calls to
`api.anthropic.com`. Always go through `callClaude()` so retries +
prompt-caching + cost tracking + budget enforcement happen. callClaude
accepts both the positional (`prompt, model, max_tokens, extra`) and
object (`{system, user, model, max_tokens, extra}`) shapes.

**Rule 3 — Webhook security has 3 parts.** HMAC verification (already
in `services/paddle.js`, `services/stripe/index.js`) AND timestamp
tolerance (≤5 min) AND idempotency via `lib/webhookEvents.markProcessed`.
Skipping any one of them leaves a replay or duplicate-fire bug.

**Rule 4 — PostgREST filters need encoded inputs.** Anything that ends
up in a `?id=eq.X` filter must be UUID-validated + `encodeURIComponent`'d
at the boundary. See `middleware/planGate.js`, `middleware/planLimits.js`,
`lib/costGuard.js` for the pattern.

**Rule 5 — OAuth state binds to user + nonce.** Never sign state with
just `businessId` — that's account-takeover-able. The current scheme
(`services/oauth/{meta,google}.js`) signs
`businessId|userId|nonce|ts|hmac`.

**Rule 6 — Customer-facing generation goes through the closed-loop creative
system.** Don't write raw `callClaude` for customer-facing copy. Use:

- `lib/groundingContext.js` to inject wins+losses+VoC+cohort+brand into the prompt
- `lib/nBestReranker.js` to oversample candidates and judge-pick top-K
- `lib/adversarialCritic.js` to critique + rewrite before shipping
- `lib/performanceMemory.js` for pgvector-backed semantic search over past
  outcomes — pass `semanticQuery` + `performanceMemory` to `buildGroundingContext()`
  and the wins/losses become RAG-quality (vs recency-based fallback).
  See ADR-0005. The pattern is already in `services/creative-engine/index.js`
  — mirror it. Output specificity from grounded prompts beats raw model
  quality every time, and the cost is bounded (~$0.03/business/day).

---

## 6a. Cold-Start Corpus — Industry-Aware Grounding

(Engineering name: "marketing corpus pre-trainer". Customer-facing name:
"industry expertise on day 1.")

A pre-trained global corpus (`marketing_corpus` table, migration 062) seeded
from public sources — Meta Ad Library expert brands, Google Places top
cohorts, award winners (Cannes/Effie/D&AD/One Show). Lets new customers
retrieve from world-class examples on day 1 instead of an empty table.

**Load-bearing constraints (Wave 59 hardening — do not break):**

- **Quality floor: 0.55.** Rows scoring below `qualityScorer.ACCEPTABLE_THRESHOLD`
  are dropped, not stored at low score. Prevents mediocre examples from
  polluting retrieval.
- **Eligibility gate: brand + runtime.** Meta ads must be from an expert
  brand (or award winner) AND have runtime ≥ 60 days before they reach
  the classifier. Saves Haiku cost on rows we'd reject anyway.
- **Award tier: 0.95.** Brands in `expertSources.AWARD_WINNERS` always
  get top-tier score regardless of other signals.
- **Tier-gated injection: free=0, growth=2, agency=5.** Free tier never
  sees corpus rows — pure monetization + cost lever. Unknown plan = free.
- **Cold-start switch: 50 published pieces.** Once a customer has shipped
  ≥ `COLD_START_THRESHOLD` of their own content, corpus turns off — their
  own performance data is the better signal.
- **Prompt caching: enabled.** Corpus block tagged `cache_control:ephemeral`
  via `ctx.toCacheableBlocks()`. 90% input-cost reduction on repeat calls
  within the 5-min TTL.
- **Taxonomy refresh: quarterly, Slack-only.** `services/taxonomy-refresh`
  proposes adds/removes via Claude → posts to Slack. NEVER auto-merges —
  humans review + open a PR.

See ADR-0008 for the full architecture.

## 7. Local dev quickstart

See [README.md](./README.md) for the canonical version. Short form:

```bash
git clone <fork> && cd Maroa.ai
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# fill in SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, ANTHROPIC_KEY, N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
# OAUTH_TOKEN_ENC_KEY (run: openssl rand -hex 32)
npm run dev
```

## 8. Production test account

| Field         | Value                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| email         | `idealbekteshi06@gmail.com`            |
| business_name | `ibgboost.com`                         |
| business_id   | `fea4aae5-14b4-486d-89f4-33a7d7e4ab60` |
| plan          | `growth`                               |

Use this UUID for end-to-end test calls. Never run destructive ops
against it without explicit approval — it's a real account.

## 9. What's next (active backlog)

- Carve `server.js` into `routes/*.js` per domain. Target: server.js
  under 4,000 lines (currently ~12,600).
- Write the OAuth plaintext drop migration after the backfill is verified
  in production. Migration 060 was repurposed for subscriptions_rls — the
  drop migration was never written. See `scripts/encrypt-oauth-tokens.js`
  for the backfill procedure.
- Real test harnesses for fake-Anthropic / fake-Inngest / fake-Supabase.
- Mutation testing on the prompt-module scoring code.
- Status page + on-call rota.

See [LEARNINGS.md](./LEARNINGS.md) for the full decision rationale on
the items above.

## 10. Audit hardening (2026-05-18 → 2026-05-19)

A full backend audit ran on 2026-05-18; the fixes landed across the
following turn. Highlights — read the linked code if extending these
patterns:

- **Circuit breakers wired** — `lib/breakers.js` is now actually called.
  callClaude, FB/IG publish, Replicate, DALL-E, SerpAPI, and the OpenAI
  embedding helper all route through `lib/externalHttp.js` (breaker +
  retry + per-service timeout). New external HTTP code SHOULD use it.
- **Retry-with-jitter** — `lib/retryWithJitter.js`. Composes with the
  breaker; honors `Retry-After`; respects `AbortSignal`. Tests under
  `tests/retry-with-jitter.test.js` cover the matrix.
- **Per-service timeouts** — `lib/serviceTimeouts.js`. Higgsfield gets
  90s (image gen is slow), Paddle gets 10s (fail-fast on payment), Anthropic
  25s, etc. Default is 15s.
- **Idempotency-Key middleware** — `middleware/idempotency.js` + migration 069. Mounted as `optional` on `/api/content/*`, `/api/social/*`,
  `/api/ad-campaigns/*`, `/api/email-lifecycle/*`, `/api/launch`. Flip
  to `required` after frontend rollout. Browser retries no longer
  double-fire mutations.
- **Atomic multi-table writes** — migration 071 + `sbRpc()` helper. Use
  `cold_start_initialize` and `ad_optimizer_decision` instead of two
  separate `sbPost`/`sbPatch` calls when the rows are tied.
- **JSONB validation** — `lib/eventSchemas.js` + migration 070. CHECK
  constraints enforce `payload->>'kind'` on `events`, basic shape on
  `approvals` and `decision_logs`. App-side Zod validators in
  `validateEventPayload` etc. Use them on every insert.
- **Two-phase webhook dedup** — `lib/webhookEvents.js` now marks rows
  as `received` → side-effect → `processed`/`failed`. Failed events are
  re-runnable on retry; previously they were silently swallowed by the
  PK constraint.
- **SSE stream tickets (2026-06-11)** — the audit's removal of `?token=`
  broke EventSource (browsers can't attach an Authorization header), so the
  dashboard status stream + WF15 stream 401'd silently. Fix: JWT-authed
  `POST /api/stream-ticket` mints a 60s HMAC ticket binding
  user_id+business_id (`lib/streamTicket.js`, oauthState-style signing,
  `STREAM_TICKET_SECRET` → falls back to `N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET`);
  `middleware/requireAuthOrWebhookSecret.js` accepts `?ticket=` ONLY on GET
  `/webhook/dashboard-events` + `/webhook/wf15-stream/:id`
  (`req.authSource='stream-ticket'`), with live ownership re-checked by the
  owner gate. Never widen the allowlist to mutating routes; long-lived JWTs
  stay banned from URLs. Tests: `tests/stream-ticket.test.js`.
- **Real readiness probes** — `/readyz` actually pings Anthropic
  (`/v1/models`), Higgsfield (`/v1/models`), and reports DLQ accumulation
  - open breaker snapshot. 10s cache so a flood of probes doesn't DDoS.
- **DLQ auto-alerts** — Inngest terminal failures now ping Slack
  (`SLACK_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`) and Sentry. Same-function rate-limit 5 min.
- **Bounded in-process caches** — `lib/groundingContext.js` caps at 5k
  entries. Metrics registry caps at 10k label combinations. abuseDetector
  consistent 10k cap.
- **Sentry release tag** — auto-resolves to `RELEASE` env → Railway commit
  SHA → `git describe`. Source maps now match the running version.

See `LEARNINGS.md` for the audit decision rationale.
